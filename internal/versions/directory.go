// Sealed is the image of a page version sealed by a commit, shared by the
// directories that reference it. Before the append it holds only the
// image; the coordinator places it in the WAL right after the append, and
// releases the image after the Sync, when reads go to the WAL. The
// content never changes. A reader that already holds the image keeps it:
// there is no buffer pool, so the garbage collector frees it last.
//
// Place and Release are called by one goroutine, the coordinator; readers
// load the state at any time. A version that a later intent of the same
// group replaced is never appended, so it is never placed: the
// coordinator releases only the versions it placed (see Placed).
